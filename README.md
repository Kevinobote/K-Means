# K-means Clustering with Visualization

This repository provides a simple example of how to perform K-means clustering on a dataset and visualize the results using Python. 

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install these packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Steps

### 1. Import the Required Libraries

First, import the necessary libraries for numerical operations, plotting, and K-means clustering.

### 2. Prepare Your Dataset

Prepare your dataset, ensuring it is in a suitable format (e.g., a NumPy array). For demonstration purposes, you can generate a random dataset or load your own data.

### 3. Fit the K-means Model

Initialize the K-means model with the desired parameters, such as the number of clusters, and fit it to your dataset.

### 4. Extract Labels and Centroids

After fitting the model, extract the cluster labels and centroids from the K-means object. These will be used for plotting.

### 5. Plot the Results

Use `matplotlib` to create a scatter plot:
- Plot the data points, coloring them according to their cluster labels.
- Plot the centroids with a different marker style and color to distinguish them from the data points.

### Full Code Example

Put all the steps together in one script, ensuring you follow the logical sequence from importing libraries to plotting the results.

## Explanation

1. **Importing Libraries**: Ensure you import `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `KMeans` from `scikit-learn` for numerical operations, plotting, and clustering, respectively.

2. **Preparing Dataset**: Load or generate your dataset. Ensure it is in the correct format (e.g., a 2D NumPy array).

3. **Fitting the Model**: Initialize the K-means model with parameters like the number of clusters (`n_clusters`) and other initialization parameters. Fit the model to your dataset.

4. **Extracting Labels and Centroids**: After the model is fitted, retrieve the cluster labels and centroids. The labels indicate the cluster assignment for each data point, and the centroids represent the center of each cluster.

5. **Plotting Results**: Create a scatter plot using `matplotlib`:
   - Color the data points based on their cluster labels.
   - Plot the centroids with a distinct style and color to make them stand out.

This guide provides a clear and concise explanation of the steps required to perform K-means clustering and visualize the results, making it easier for anyone to follow along. If you have any questions or issues, feel free to open an issue in this repository.
